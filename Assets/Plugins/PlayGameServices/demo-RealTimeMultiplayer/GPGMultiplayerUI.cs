/// This demo scene is setup to show how to get a real-time multiplayer game started in a variety of ways (via received invitation, programmatically or via the player selector).
///
/// First, you must have an authenticated player (Authenticate button). Once you do you can pick how you want to start the room (Room Creation section). The demo scene will
/// automatically show the Google Play waiting room UI (showWaitingRoom) when a room is created or joined (note that this is an optional step for when you make your game).
/// Once all players are connected it gets dismissed and we are in a real-time game ready to start sending data.
///
/// For demonstration purposes, you can send data (via the Send Unreliable Message to All button) or leave the room (via the Leave Room button) once connected.
