* @class SplineNode

* @brief This class represents a control node of the Spline.
*
* This class stores data about the position and orientation of the control node as well as information about 
* the spline parameter that is associated to the control node and the normalized distance to the next adjacent control node.
* For advanced use there is also a custom value that will be interpolated according to the interpolation mode that is used to calculate the spline.
