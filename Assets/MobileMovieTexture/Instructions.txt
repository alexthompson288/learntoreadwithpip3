Mobile Movie Texture 1.1.7

Encoding new movies
	Mobile Movie Texture only supports ogg theora encoded videos. The easiest way to encode ogg theora is to use http://v2v.cc/~j/ffmpeg2theora/download.html or VLC http://www.videolan.org/vlc/ .

Starting from scratch
	Firstly you will need a material to play the movie on. Create a new material
	Set your new material's shader to "Color Space/YCrCbtoRGB"

	Next add the MobileMovieTexture/MobileMovieTexture.cs to an active game object in the scene
	The path string field in MobileMovieTexture points to your movie within the StreamingAssets/ directory without the "StreamingAssets/" on the start of it. Always use forward slashes if you need your movie in a sub directory. Forward slashes work on all platforms.

	Now apply the material you created to an object in the scene.

	That should be it

Changes
	Version 1.1.7 24/11/2012
		•Android: Fix bug in streaming from OBB package, thanks floky!

	Version 1.1.6 29/10/2012
		•Android: Auto stream from OBB package
		
	Version 1.1.5 23/08/2012
		•All platforms: Add a split alpha demo+shader to have a seperate alpha channel in your videos. Chroma keying works well for cutting out people but doesn't work well for a lot of semi transparent things, like particles. Split alpha works well for semi transparent stuff.
		•iOS/Android: Fixed the CrCb channels not lining up properly with videos that have half sized CrCb buffers. Thanks to android_dev for the example.
		•All platforms: Fixed video picture offsets. Thanks to Bryan @ Annosoft for the example.
		•All platforms: Fixed the infinite loop if you didn't have a onFinish delegate.
		•iOS/Android: About a 15% performance improvement up in mobile shaders 

	Version 1.1.4 21/04/2012
		•All platforms: Add frame skipping when video is decoding too slowly
		•All platforms: Add a color tintable transparent shader
		•All platforms: Fix some transparent tags in shaders		
		
	Version 1.1.3 7/02/2012
		•All Platforms: fix a looping bug	
		•All Platforms: fix a warning in the chroma key editor
		•iOS: Add XCode 3.2.X version of the lib
		•Reorganise the package so the Plugins and Streaming Assets are in the correct place

	Version 1.1.2 16/01/2011
		•All Platforms: Added a chroma key shader, editor and sample
		•iOS/Android: Fixed corruption issuse with a GL.InvalidateState
		•All Platforms: Fixed 2 memory leaks in the native code
		•All Platforms: Fixed YCrCb naming in the shaders

	Version 1.1.1 28/12/2011
		•iOS/Android: Work around a texture allocation bug in Unity if nothing else is drawing in the sample scene, by drawing a gui button

	Version 1.1 27/12/2011
		•All Platforms: now do color space conversion on the gpu. This resulted in a 2x performance increase in iOS and a 1.7x in Android, in my tests.
		•All Platforms: There is a big memory saving from not storing the converted 16bit rgb in ram. For example for the test movies, we saved NextPow2(640) * NextPow2(360) * 2 bytes = 1Mb
		•Android: now has cpu features detection and uses NEON instructions where available. iOS always uses NEON.
		•Windows/OSX: use power of 2 YCrCb textures for a massive speed up.
		•Windows/OSX: use SetPixels32 for another speed up.
		•All Platforms: Removing the color space conversion code saved ~10k
		•Android: Fixed a bug on when resuming
		•Windows/OSX: Hand code the YCrCb shader to work around bad cgsl compilation by Unity

		Known issues
		Android: There is an intermittent crash in the Adreno 200 OpenGL driver on my Nexus one, it crashes deep within the Areno driver in my call to glTexSubImage2D, in rb_texture_find_eviction_candidate in __memcmp16. I will do everything I can to find a solution or a workaround
		iOS: Currently only supports armv7 (not 3G)

Trouble shooting
	iOS link errors 
		Does your xcode project include libtheorawrapper.a? If not add it, or let unity replace your build.
	iOS/Android missing _OpenStreamDemo
		Congratulations, you just upgraded from the free version! The function is renamed to OpenStream in the paid version, double check your MobileMovieTexture.cs and your plugin .a/.dll/.bundle are upgraded as well 
	iOS/Android I can't see a movie
		Did you select armv7 and open gl es 2.0?
		

If you have any questions/problems drop me a mail dan@defiantdev.com. If you have a great experience, the asset store could do with a comment. If you have a terrible one mail me! If you make anything cool with it, I'd love to know.
